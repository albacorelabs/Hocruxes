# Albacore - Horcruxes

> ## "Well, you split your soul, you see, and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if oneâ€™s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged."


Horcruxes is a threshold secret sharing scheme over Elliptic Curves. A secret can be split into **n** total parts with **m** (where m <= n) parts required to reconstruct the secret.

This repo is currently a **work in progress**.

## TODO 
* Explore bilinear pairings to remove trust in secret dealer
* Refine reconstruction algorithm for secret sharing

# Requirements and testing
- Install Haskell and Stack
- git clone git@github.com:albacorelabs/Horcruxes.git
- cd Horcruxes 
- Build and Test:  `stack build --test` , Note: tests for reconstructing secrets currently takes a medium amount of time as arbitraty instances can create secret splits > 40.



# How to use
## Inputs:
- S - A secret in the form of a point on the elliptic curve
- m - The threshold signatures required for reconstrucing the secret
- n - The total number of horcruxes the secret needs to be split into.

## Usage
- #### Splitting a secret
    - `split_horcrux m n S` will return an array of [(**Integer**, **Point**)] to be distributed to the various secret holders. Integer is required to understand the **f(i)** required for reconstruction and **Point** represents the secret shares. 

- #### Reconstrucing a secret
    - `reconstruct_horcrux [(Integer,Point)]` will return the reconstruct the original secret, S.

- #### Horcrux Helpers
    - `compress_horcrux Point` will return the compressed hex-encoded bytestring of the Point. It will discard the y-coord and append the bytes 02 or 03 depending on the parity of the y-coord.
  
    - `decompress_horcrux Cruve ByteString` will return point corresponding to the compressed bytestring passed in. It currently uses [Cipolla's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipolla%27s_algorithm) for determining y in the equation y^2 = x (mod p). There is also the potential to use the [Tonelli-Shanks Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm)  although more investigation is required to understand if/when it is more optimal.
